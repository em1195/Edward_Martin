This folder contains all the code used in my Introduction to Neural Networks module project, undertaken in my third year at the 
University of York. 

The purpose of this assessment is to use the data provided in dataR2.csv to build a Neural Network tp correctly predict the
classification of a patients input into either cancerous (1) or cancer-free (0). Marks are not however just given for producing
"perfect" results, but for justifying the actions you took to arrive at those results, with references and explainations of the 
relavent literature, showing your understanding.
